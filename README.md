## SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE


## About
For this project, we will be making requests to a API and also doing things with it while sending it back. My intention for this project was to create
a TIC TAC TOE game that will be theme after the Super Mario video games.

## Planning
First I created a wireframe and users stories to physically conceputalize how I wanted the game and layout to look. I then proceeded on coding out the gameboard layout using bootstap to think abou how to implement my game logic using Javascript and jQuery.


## Technologies Used

The technology being used was mostly front-end using jQuery, JS to communicate with the API. 

* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to sign up, so that I can create a account to store my game stats.
* As a user, I want to sign in, so that I can use the same account I create with my save game stats.
* As a user, I want to change password, so that if I can have a new password to protect my account.
* As a user, I want to be able to sign out, so that my account isn't still login on to any device that I might not own.
* As a user, I want to be able to start a tictactoe game, so that I can play the game at my request.
* As a user, I want to be able to rotate between x and o, so that I can make progress towards finishing the game.
* As a user, I want to be notify when I have won, loss, or tie in the game, so that I can know if my state after the game ended.
* As a user, I want to be to view my games played, so that I can track how many games I played.

## Unsolved Problems
I couldn't get rid of the view game bugs, I think it wasn't getting back the data from the store file where we sent define in the API. Another thing, I wanted to fix the media size for larger screens to look a bit better. Overall, with this being my first ever project I like it a lot and got me fire up to learn a lot more.
